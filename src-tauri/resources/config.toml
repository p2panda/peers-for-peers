# SCHEMAS

# List of schema ids which a node will replicate, persist and expose on the
# GraphQL API.
#
# When allowing a schema you automatically opt into announcing, replicating and
# materializing documents connected to it, supporting applications and networks
# which are dependent on this data.
#
# It is recommended to set this list to all schema ids your own application
# should support, including all important system schemas. For example:
#
allow_schema_ids = [
    # To discover new schemas, set your node to replicate schema definition
    # documents by including these two built-in schema ids. Your node will now
    # search for and replicate schemas which have been published to the
    # network.
    "schema_definition_v1",
    "schema_field_definition_v1",

    # To replicate documents which represent blobs (binary files) include the
    # following two built-in schema ids. This does not instruct your node to
    # replicate any blobs it finds on the network, but only those which are
    # dependencies of # other documents you already have.
    #
    # If you only want to replicate the meta data, not the binary content,
    # then only include the `blob_v1`.
